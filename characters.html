  Constance Du
</h4>
<p>
  27 years old; a yappie (yuppie but Asian) consultant who has followed the successful Asian daughter path to a tee; her day-to-day consists of being surrounded by tall, white, former frat bros who confuse her for the other Asian girl in the office; nonetheless,
  she is a good sport; she graduated from Penn and moved back to L.A. to be close to family; as an only child, she knows her parents rely on her for emotional and the occasional financial support; she values stability and security above all else.

  Anna Li
</h4>
<p>
  26 years old; has always prided herself on being the most creative person in a room full of engineers; but since graduating from Stanford, she's been unsure if she made the right call in pursuing a career as a software engineer; sure, the money is nice
  (and as a result, so is her apartment), but she's always wanted to be an artist; she's both fully supportive and slightly envious of the more passion-driven lifestyle she sees her best friend/younger brother, Justin, living; she is a creative at heart,
  best described as mom-friendly edgy.

  Justin Li
</h4>
<p>
  23 years old; considers himself an Asian American social justice advocate hyphen activist; he's not really sure what that means now that he's graduated, and struggles to find a way to make money as a so-called advocate, mainly doing administrative work
  at slow-paced nonprofits; his older sister, Anna, is his best friend and biggest supporter; he isn't afraid of confrontation, and often resents the "softer" approach to Asian identity many of his peers take; as a result, he ends up in a lot of arguments,
  but isn't that all a part of being an advocate?

  Chloe Chen
</h4>
<p>
  22 years old; a hapa who, frankly, can pass as white; for her whole life, people have misunderstood how she relates to her Asian identity, either because they miss her biracial heritage, or they don't listen to her; currently an economics major at UCLA,
  she is also involved in a hip hop dance troupe, a pre-professional business fraternity, and the Chinese Students Association; she is open-minded and patient; she is a strong believer that nothing in this world is as simple as black and white; except
  when it comes to the Bruins (because they're the best).

  Jonathan Shen
</h4>
<p>
  26 years old; has spent his whole life as the black sheep of the entire Asian community; his grades have never been particularly good, but for as long as he can remember, he's been making music; though he originally learned the piano (under duress), he
  later started writing and producing his own hip hop tracks; his rapper name is DominaSHEN, and he's been working with a one-track mind to elevate his music career, much to his parents' dismay; only recently has he experienced a minor (but much deserved)
  success in his hip hop career.
