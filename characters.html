  Constance Du
</h4>
<p>
  Connie is a yappie (yuppie but Asian) consultant who has followed the successful Asian daughter path to a tee. Her day to day consists of being surrounded by tall, white, former frat bros that confuse her for the other Asian girl in the office. Nonetheless, Constance is a good sport. She graduated from Penn and moved back to LA to be close to family. As an only child, she knows her parents rely on her for emotional and the occasional financial support. Constance values stability and security above all else.

  Anna Li
</h4>
<p>
  Anna has always prided herself on being the most creative person in a room full of engineers. But since graduating from Stanford, she’s been unsure if she made the right call in pursuing a career as a software engineer. Sure, the money is nice (and as a result, so is her apartment), but she’s always wanted to be an artist. She’s both fully supportive and slightly envious of the more passion-driven lifestyle she sees her best friend/younger brother, Justin, living. Anna is a creative at heart, best described as mom-friendly edgy.

  Justin Li
</h4>
<p>
  Justin considers himself an Asian American social justice advocate hyphen activist. He’s not really sure what that means now that he’s graduated, and struggles to find a way to make money as a so-called advocate, mainly doing administrative work at slow-paced nonprofits. His older sister, Anna, is his best friend and biggest supporter. Justin isn’t afraid of confrontation, and often resents the “softer” approach to Asian identity many of his peers take. As a result, he ends up in a lot of arguments, but isn’t that all a part of being an advocate?

  Chloe Chen
</h4>
<p>
  Chloe is a hapa that, frankly, can pass as white. For her whole life, people have misunderstood how she relates to her Asian identity, either because they miss her biracial heritage, or they don’t listen to her. Currently an economics major at UCLA, Chloe is also involved in a hip hop dance troupe, a pre-professional business fraternity, and the Chinese Students Association. Chloe is open-minded and patient. She is a strong believer that nothing in this world is as simple as black and white. Except when it comes to the Bruins.

  Jonathan Shen
</h4>
<p>
  Jonathan has spent his whole life as the black sheep of the entire Asian community. His grades have never been particularly good, but for as long as he can remember, he’s been making music. Though he originally learned the piano (under duress), he later started writing and producing his own hip hop tracks. His rapper name is DominaSHEN, and he’s been working with a one-track mind to elevate his music career, much to his parents’ dismay. Only recently has he experienced a minor (but much deserved) success in his hip hop career.
